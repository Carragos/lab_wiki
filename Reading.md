Read widely, deeply and regularly. Read weird things. Keep track of what you read, and make notes; I strongly recommend Zotero with the Zotfile plugin for managing both pdfs and references.
 
 Some of my favorite papers and books:

#### Perceptual decision-making
- Siegel M, Donner TH, Engel AK (2012) Spectral fingerprints of large-scale neuronal interactions. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 13:121–134.
- Summerfield C, de Lange FP (2014) Expectation in perceptual decision making: neural and computational mechanisms. Nat Rev Neurosci 15:745–756.
- O’Connell RG, Kelly SP (2021) Neurophysiology of Human Perceptual Decision-Making. Annual Review of Neuroscience 44:null.

#### Statistics
- Aarts E, Verhage M, Veenvliet JV, Dolan CV, van der Sluis S (2014) A solution to dependency: using multilevel analysis to accommodate nested data. Nature Neuroscience 17:491–496.

#### Theory and philosophy
- Teller DY (1984) Linking propositions. Vision Res 24:1233–1246.

#### History of science
- Gleick J (1988) Chaos: Making a New Science. Penguin.
- Lindsay G (2021) Models of the Mind: How Physics, Engineering and Mathematics Have Shaped Our Understanding of the Brain. Bloomsbury Publishing.

#### Electrophysiology
