### Getting started at the cognitive psychology unit
Ask secretary [Eva Potters](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/eva-potters#tab-1) to be added to the _FSW - Cogpsy_ mailing list. 

To add the associated calendar: in Outlook (doesn't work on the web version, unfortunately), click 'add shared calendar' and search for _FSW - Cogpsy_. Avoid the 'FSW - Cognitive psychology lab 2020', it's not in use. If you only see events as 'busy' or 'free' (without content), you can request access via [this link](https://helpdesk.universiteitleiden.nl/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=6b7c11114bbb43128ee08b9de64eddc8&openedFromService=true) after logging in with your UCLN account. _Update_: I haven't gotten this to work so far, let me know if you manage.

### Meetings and colloquia
Cognitive Psychology colloquia are held at 13.00 on Wednesdays, currently on Zoom. Email [Julia Folz](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/julia-folz#tab-1) if you're interested in receiving weekly invitations.
