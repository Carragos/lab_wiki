*I aspire and promise to:*
- Support you in your research and career planning.
- Respond to questions and give feedback in a timely manner.
    - I aim to respond to emails in a few days, or at most a week. If something is urgent (e.g. a problem with data collection, a sudden deadline for a grant application) I will usually respond more quickly.
    - If you want feedback on your work, a letter of reference, or other input from me, please give me a heads-up a few weeks in advance (e.g. as soon as you know that you're applying for something, or when you start writing a draft). I can then block off time to go over your work and give feedback immediately. Note that if you can't meet this deadline, it may go to the bottom of my priority list and I may be less inclined. So plan ahead, and allow yourself (and me) some buffers.

*I expect you to:*
- Treat colleagues, participants and lab equipment with respect. 
- Own up to your mistakes
- take ownership of your research project.
- Organize your work, and practice project and time management
    - When we meet, please take notes and especially write down 
- Take a proactive role in your career development: let me know if you want to attend a conference, apply for a (travel) grant, or give a talk. 


- Mentoring: make use of the Cognitive Psychology Unit's mentoring scheme (ask Sander Nieuwenhuis).
