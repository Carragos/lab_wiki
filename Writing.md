Practice version control; I like Google Docs, which works well with Zotero.

I'm a sucker for *nice-looking figures* (and fonts). Learn how to make your figures look good straight out of Python/Matlab/Julia/R, and minimize the time spent changing things in Illustrator/InkScape. This will not only save a lot of time in the long run, it also makes your analyses more reproducible.

#### Authorship
Scientific autorship is a tricky business (see [here](https://tobiasdonner.net/our-labs-take-on-authorship/) for discussion in my PhD lab). I aim to discuss authorship early on, clarify expectations, and give regular updates when a project changes. If you are unsure about authorship, please let me know asap.

Apart from traditional authorship order, we will indicate each person's contributions to the project in a tabular form (inspired by [Nick Steinmetz](https://t.co/R5hQiSYvKt?amp=1), further develop in [IBL](https://iiif.elifesciences.org/lax:63711%2Felife-63711-fig6-v2.tif/full/1500,/0/default.jpg)).
